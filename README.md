##Project 1 - Cloud Links 

#Imagine a world with one place you can store and organise those links? 

Isnt is annoying when you read an article you like, or you have many recipies from many different websites, or you find some useful or usless information that you want to come back to or share. 

Your tutor or boss chucks extra reading links left right and centre, these links usually get chucked (or forgotten) into your notes app or scribbled on a bit of paper or left open in your browser and you have to scroll through your history until you find that one thing you were looking for. Is it not just exhausting thinking about all of that? Cloud links was built to solve that for you.

#What I would like to add?

- Social media icons
- Clean, condensed code
- More styling and features
- Image / file upload
- Apply web scraping 
- Like, comments and shares
- Public feed that shows popular links from the web. Eg news articles so the user can check out these articles and store them

#What I would do next time?

- Take a bit more time in understanding what I want the app to do and achieve
- Spend more time to understand the navigation and what I need to do to connnect the models together
- A task list for each day
- Write a list of all variables needed and give variables better names. 
- DO NOT PANIC CODE
- Git hub more often (everytime something works)
